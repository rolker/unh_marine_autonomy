**Issue**: #351 — marine_web_view: upload to S3 via boto3 instead of shelling out to the AWS CLI
**Comment**: (best-effort post follows this entry; not recorded inline)
**Scope verdict**: well-scoped

### Scope Assessment

**Well-scoped?** Yes — replacing two near-identical `subprocess.run(['aws', 's3',
'cp', ...])` call sites with a shared boto3 helper fits one PR, with tests. The
issue correctly identifies both renderer sites (`state_renderer.py:501`,
`coverage_renderer.py:1274`) and the declarability problem (`awscli` has no
apt candidate on noble; `python3-boto3` does — verified: `apt-cache policy
python3-boto3` → `1.34.46+dfsg-1ubuntu1` on this host).

**Right repo?** Yes — `marine_web_view` is domain-specific project content in
`rolker/unh_marine_autonomy`; no workspace-vs-project separation concern.

**Dependencies**: none blocking. The issue itself notes this is prerequisite
housekeeping ahead of the EC2 relocation once `udp_bridge` can relay
([udp_bridge#51](https://github.com/rolker/udp_bridge/issues/51)) — on EC2,
boto3 picks up the instance IAM role automatically, whereas the current
`aws s3 cp --profile` shell-out is the pattern that should *not* travel to a
cloud host with long-lived keys. That's a real scope-timing rationale, not
just a nice-to-have: it argues for doing this now rather than after the move.

### Principle Alignment

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Enforcement over documentation | OK | Directly fixes an enforcement gap: the manifest currently can't declare its own runtime dependency, so a README section is the only thing standing between a new operator and a first-upload failure. `<depend>python3-boto3</depend>` makes the manifest tell the truth. |
| A change includes its consequences | Watch | Issue's own consequence list (package.xml comment, README section, tests) is good, but misses one: `marine_web_view/scripts/refresh_chart_tiles.py` also shells out to `aws s3 cp` / `aws s3 sync` (lines ~292, 408, 428) under a *different* profile (`ccom-jhc`, not `p11-renderer`). It is not one of "both nodes," so the acceptance criterion "neither renderer invokes the `aws` binary" is technically satisfiable without touching it — but the Scope section also says "remove the README's 'Runtime prerequisite: the AWS CLI' section" outright, and that section will still be true for this script. Deleting it wholesale would leave inaccurate documentation the same day it's fixed. |
| Test what breaks | OK | Acceptance criteria list success/permission-denied/throttling upload-path tests, which is the right target now that a boto3 client can be stubbed (current tests monkeypatch `coverage_renderer.subprocess.run`/`state_renderer.subprocess.run` module-level, confirmed in `test/test_render_pass.py`). |
| Only what's needed | OK | Scope stays to the upload path; doesn't drag in unrelated renderer changes. |
| Improve incrementally | OK | Single PR, reviewable. |
| Capture decisions | OK | The issue itself records the rationale (declarability + cloud IAM posture) inline — durable even without a dedicated ADR, since this is an implementation-detail swap, not an architectural decision. |

### ADR Applicability

| ADR | Triggered | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0009 — Python package management policy | Yes | `<depend>python3-boto3</depend>` via rosdep/apt is exactly the prescribed pattern (apt/rosdep for runtime deps, never bare pip). Issue already verified the rosdep key resolves. |
| 0008 — Follow ROS 2 conventions | Yes (lightly) | Touches `package.xml` and node source; no deviation expected, but the shared-helper module (see below) should follow existing package layout conventions. |
| 0013 — progress.md vocabulary | Yes | This review and downstream phases must use the ADR-0013 entry types; no issue here. |

### Consequences

- README's "Runtime prerequisite: the AWS CLI" section should be **revised**,
  not deleted outright, if `refresh_chart_tiles.py` keeps shelling out to
  `aws` — otherwise the docs would go from "workaround, documented" to "silently
  wrong" for that script's operators.
- `package.xml`'s explanatory comment about the undeclarable `awscli` key
  already names #351 for removal — consistent with the issue, no drift there.
- Existing tests that monkeypatch `subprocess.run` on both renderer modules
  will need to change to stub the boto3 client instead — already anticipated
  by the issue's "add tests" scope item, but worth calling out explicitly so
  it isn't treated as new/unplanned test churn during review.

### Recommendations (open questions for plan-task)

- **`refresh_chart_tiles.py` is a third shell-out site, unmentioned in the
  issue.** It runs `aws s3 sync` (no single boto3 API call equivalent — sync
  is a client-side diff+multi-op the CLI implements, not one SDK call) and
  `aws s3 cp` for manifest read/write, under the `ccom-jhc` profile, invoked
  manually/out-of-band rather than as a ROS node. Recommend the plan
  explicitly scope this **out** (reasonable, given `sync` has no cheap boto3
  equivalent) but say so, and revise rather than delete the README's AWS CLI
  section to note the script is the one remaining consumer.
- **Where should the shared boto3 helper live?** The issue says "a shared
  boto3 helper" but not a module name/location. Both renderers are in
  `marine_web_view/marine_web_view/`; a natural home is a new sibling module
  (e.g. `s3_upload.py`), but this is unspecified and worth settling in the
  plan.
- **"Keep the retry/backoff semantics" overstates what exists today.**
  Reading both `_put`/`_publish`, there is no in-call retry or backoff at
  all — one `subprocess.run` attempt, a failure counter increment, and
  reliance on the *next scheduled pass* (the ROS timer, or coverage's
  dirty-tile re-queue) to retry. The plan should say explicitly that boto3's
  typed exceptions replace exit-code branching for *logging/counting*
  purposes, without introducing new in-call retry/backoff loops that don't
  exist in the current behavior (which would be a scope increase and could
  interact with the existing 20 s/30 s per-call timeouts).
- **Profile-handling asymmetry between the two current call sites**:
  `state_renderer._put` always passes `--profile self.profile`;
  `coverage_renderer._publish` passes `--profile` only when `self.profile` is
  truthy, otherwise falls through to boto3's default credential chain (see
  the comment at `coverage_renderer.py:364` about accommodating a plain
  `~/.aws/credentials`). The shared helper needs to preserve this
  distinction (or the plan should call out unifying it as a deliberate,
  reviewed behavior change rather than an incidental one).

### Actions
- [ ] Revise (don't delete) the README "Runtime prerequisite: the AWS CLI"
      section to scope it to `refresh_chart_tiles.py` once the two renderers
      no longer need it — or explicitly fold the script into scope if the
      plan decides to convert it too.
- [ ] Settle the shared-helper module name/location in the plan.
- [ ] State explicitly that "keep retry/backoff semantics" means preserving
      single-attempt-plus-next-pass-retry behavior with typed-exception
      logging, not adding new in-call retry/backoff.
- [ ] Preserve (or deliberately and visibly change) the profile-handling
      asymmetry between the two current call sites in the shared helper.

**Phases**: single

### Open questions
- [ ] README structure for the `dry_run`/no-AWS-access sentence once the "Runtime prerequisite: the AWS CLI" section is deleted wholesale — move it under per-node docs or drop as redundant (implementer's call, flagged not guessed).
- [ ] `--concurrency` default of 16 for the `refresh_chart_tiles.py` sync reimplementation vs. matching the CLI's default of 10 for parity during cutover.
